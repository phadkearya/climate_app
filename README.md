# Clima ‚òÅ

This is a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). By the end of the module, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!

This was an app made by me as a part of the fllutter course of London App Brewery. The new things learnt by me while making this app are asynchronous programming and how to use APIs.
